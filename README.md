## Usage 

To run a python script, once type the command: 
```sh
> python .\ICMP-Traceroute.py 
```
The program has a list of a few websites that can be used for running traceroute. You can uncomment and run any of them on the list.

Note: After an initial run of 10 or so replies in a trace route, you may start to get timeouts. 
Let the program run for a minute or so and then terminate with ctrl-c.
